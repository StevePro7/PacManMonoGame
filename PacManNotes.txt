blinky	red
clyde	orange
inky	light sky blue
pinky	light pink


Inky uses Blinky to determine tile / AI


Board dimensions
448 x 496

28 x 31 tiles
where each tile is 16x16


Level
Scatter
Chase


Blinky act like in Chase mode when in Scatter mode
e.g.
Level	20 dots remaining


CHASE
target sytem

when on fresh tile ghost determine which tile to go to next
work out the target i.e. where is PacMan and see if can go 3x directions
i.e. 4x directions less the 180 deg to previous direction so as to not back track
or less solid tile
whichever tile is closer then that is the direction ghost will choose

if 2x distant options are the same then choose this priority:
top
left
down
right



SCATTER
pinky	light pink	top left
blinky	red		top right
clyde	orange		bot left
inky	light sky blue	bot right


when ghosts change from scatter to chase more or chase to scatter mode
the first thing they do is switch direction to 180 deg so go opposite way


AI
blinky will simply target PacMan exact tile currently on


pinky will target 4x tiles in front of PacMan
so
if PacMan is going left then this will be 4x tiles to the left of PacMan position
if PacMan is going rght then this will be 4x tiles to the rght of PacMan position
if PacMan is going down then this will be 4x tiles to the down of PacMan position
 
exception is up
if PacMan is going -up- then this will be 4x tiles to the -up- AND 4x tiles left of PacMan position

inky uses PacMan target tile and blinky target tile to determine where to go
intermediate tile =
inky look at 2x tiles in front of PacMan position - again if up then is 2x tiles up and 2x tiles left

take vector from blinky to PacMan "intermediate" tile and rotate 180 degree
answer tile is inky target tile 

clyde
target tile = blinky i.e. directly on PacMan tile but this is only the case when Clyde is 8 or more tiles away from PacMan otherwise clyde chooses target tile as his scatter tile

FindDirection
assumes that the target position has been calculated and the distance between the destination target position and the ghost position is calculated and depending on what is bigger then set the list of 4x directions in order and work out the first feasible direction to go to


Scatter
when in scatter mode the destination target tiles are hardcoded depending on the ghost


Attack
when in attack mode the destination target tile is dependent on the ghost algorithm

e.g.
Blinky
 blinky attack tile = PacMan current tile
 direction_ = FindDirection(player_.Position.Tile);

Pinky
 pinky attack tile = 2x tiles in front of PacMan current tile
